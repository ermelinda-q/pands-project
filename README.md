## About this repository

This git repository (pands-project) holds all the files of Programming and Scripting module project, as part of my [Hdip in Computer Science in Data Analytics](https://www.gmit.ie/higher-diploma-in-science-in-computing-in-data-analytics#:~:text=You%20are%20a%20Level%208,topics%20in%20your%20original%20degree.) in [ATU](https://www.gmit.ie/).

_Files and Folders in this repository:_

_Files:_

- <analysis.py> - main file to run the program.
- $analysisFunctions.py$ - storing the following functions:
    - $create_empty_file$: creates analysis.txt file.
    - $create_iris_histograms$: generates VariablesHistogram.png to folder IrisGraphs.
    - $species_pairplot_to_folder$: generates pairplot graph of relations between variables in a given iris flower, e.g. IrisSetosaVariables.png
    - $save_iris_pairplot$: generates a pairplot graph of all variables in the DataFrame.
    - $plot_iris_petal_or_sepal$: generates a pairplot graph of variables for just petals or sepals.
- $bestFitLineMenu.py$:
    - creates a submenu to get users input of which variables to calculate/display graph of Best Fit Line.
    - function $best_fit_line$ that plots the graph of input variables and adds the best fit line.
- $correlation.py$ - holds two functions:
    - $calculate_correlation$: calculates the correlation between the variable values of the dataset.
    - $write_correlation_to_file$: creates and stores a list of tuples, output from calculate_correlation, sorts it, and writes the output in $correlation_results.txt$.
- $analysis.txt$ - a text file created when the program starts.
- $correlation_results.txt$ - generated by correlation.py file.
- $iris.scv$ - downloaded from [Michael Waskom on GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/iris.csv).
- a $.gitignore$ file.
- This $README$ file.

_Folders:_

- IrisGraphs - holds 7 .png file generated from the program (when all options of program are run).
    - BestFitLine - a subfolder where 6 .png files of graphs of plots with a best fit line are stored.
- images - holds three .jpg files of iris species analyzed in this project.

## About this project

This project is a study about Iris flower data set, or Fisher's Iris data set - a collection of measurements taken from three species of Iris flowers. Ronald Fisher, a British statistician and biologist, introduced this data set in 1936 to demonstrate linear discriminant analysis. Edgar Anderson collected the data to study the morphological differences among the Iris species. Each species has 50 samples, and four measurements—sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width—were recorded for each sample. Fisher used these measurements to create a model that can distinguish between the different Iris species. His work was published in the _Annals of Eugenics_, now known as the _Annals of Human Genetics_. [Source: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set)


## Use of this project



## Get Started

List of possible extra commands I can use for variable's summary (analysis.txt):
1. Adding a menu.

2. Sorting the array of each variable????
    - numpy:
    def bogosort(x):
    while np.any(x[:-1] > x[1:]):
        np.random.shuffle(x)
    return x
    x = np.array([2, 1, 4, 3, 5])
    bogosort(x)
    - or np.sort()
    - https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/02.08-sorting.html

List of possible commands for plotting (pyplot):

1. K-nearest neighbors:
     - https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/02.08-sorting.html
2. Plotting with matplot library:
    - https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/04.00-introduction-to-matplotlib.html
    - Saving figures to file:
    fig.savefig('my_figure.png')
    - To confirm that it contains what we think it contains, let's use the IPython Image object to display the contents of this file:
    ' from IPython.display import Image
    ' Image('my_figure.png')
    https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/04.00-introduction-to-matplotlib.html
    - scatter plots:
    https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/04.02-simple-scatter-plots.html
    - Histograms:
    https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/04.05-histograms-and-binnings.html
    - Seaborn:
    https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/04.14-visualization-with-seaborn.html
    - Machine Learning:
    https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/05.01-what-is-machine-learning.html
    https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/05.03-hyperparameters-and-model-validation.html
    https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/05.06-linear-regression.html
